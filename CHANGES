Changes in PeZ 3.1 (Sep 29,1997)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Changes:
- Big Upgrade to Matlab 5.x. Now recognizes version/machine and runs accordingly
- Big speed improvements in the rt-drag. Now uses Xor EXCEPT on MACs. Macs
   seem to have some kind of update bug with Xor plots- they don't draw the
   plot initially. Macs instead use normal updates.
- Non-integer gains: Now accepts values from 0:30, decimal. 
- Changed Frequency plots axis for sampling normalization(Dr. McClellan)
- Added red origin line for impulse response plots, cyan colors for others

Matlab v5.x Changes:
**WindowButtonMotionFcn/WindowButtonUpFcn:

      There seems to be a conceptual disagreement with Matlab 5.0's window
      functions. Matlab is more or less sequential code, right? Well, it
      appears as though you can continue to get WindowButtonMotion calls
      even while you're handling a WindowButtonUpFcn. The short- if you
      were still moving the mouse while you let go of the button, you were
      likely to have the buttonup command manipulate data that the motion
      functions were about to manipulate. I've put a semaphore around the
      code to half-fix this, but I disagree with the apparent implementation
      that window functions are _not_ atomic.


**uiput/get_file: Had to change the cals around a little because old version was
      just using uigetfile to get a filename.  5.0 checks for a valid file,
      so you couldn't use it to export a file.

**isempty() vs ==[] comparing: 5.0 gives a warning if checking (a==b) if b=[].
      made the isempty() calls explicit. There's still one or two somewhere..

**ginput() refresh: Added a refresh every time ginput() is used because the 
      cursor would disappear on the second call. Not sure why. The refresh
      works, though the cursor does not appear until the mouse gets moved..?


**.mat files: Looks like there's a difference between v5 and v4 .mat data files.

**plot colors: Mv5.x has white backgrounds. Changed all to explicit calls.



Changes in PeZ 3.0 (June 10,1996)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Major Changes)


- Pez Configuration Window
  - Set mirroring (At the request of some people that wanted complex
				   filters/uneven Mag plots)
  - Set Precision (ie, how close two objects can be before being merged)
  - Boot Options(Sizes, Plot configs,etc)

- Graphical Panel for Import/Export Options, including:
  - Add by Poly/Root equations
  - Import (extract) from Matlab .MAT data file
  - Import from "filtdemo"
  - Export to Matlab file
  
- Filter Gain control

- First stab at Group Delay function

- Now using Mathwork's "Printer Dialogue Box"-->uiprint (more options)
  ::  Thanks to D.L. Hallman  Herrick Labs/Purdue University for  ::
  ::   allowing me to include this and make a few modifications   ::
  
- Fixed minor real-time drag move with Horizontal mirroring.

- Moved pez_is_hit to pez_hit, for MSW3.1's 8.3 filename(worked
	before, but some people had trouble unarchiving)

- Ditched the Edit Point-2-Point option, no longer needed

- Cleaned up exit routine(Now cleans out all variables used)	

	
	

Changes in PeZ 2.8 (Not really given out to anyone)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed the all-pass add.  Used to be a mirror across the unit circle,
    now is the more practical   r and 1/r.

- Moved into speed redraws: now uses xors for erasing, therefore can
    greatly speed up moving of objects. Note that for Drag & Draw, this
    fixes the mag/phase plot axis, but in my opinion this is a plus.
    I see it as more useful to see changes made without rescaling the axis.
    
- Can now drag by just clicking on the object. No more "Drag w/ Mouse" 
    button! Much easier, and uses Matlab for object identification
    instead of own calculations. 

- Added Magnitude in dB optionfor plots

- Recoded all of the move functions. More consistent style, tighter
	code, and converted to functions (before it was scripted).

- Made pez_import() function

- Started making things less global
