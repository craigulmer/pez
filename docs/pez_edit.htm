By pressing the Edit By Co-Ord button from the main menu, the user may
numerically edit any Pole or Zero in the complex Z-Plane. The following
menu will appear for the user to make changes to the filter:

<P>The basic procedure for editing a pole/zero's co-ordinates is to
<OL>
<LI>
Press the Select a Pole or Zero Button</LI>

<LI>
With the cross-haired cursor, select a pole/zero to edit. If a pole/zero
was selected, values will appear in the real/imag/mag/angle edit boxes,
and the Make Current Change button will appear. (Aligning the cross-hairs
may not always be easy)</LI>

<LI>
Edit the Co-Ordinates numerically, <B>pressing enter after each change</B>.
PeZ only reads an edit box when it receives an enter.</LI>

<LI>
Press the Make Current Change button to finalize the change.</LI>
</OL>
Next to the Angle edit box is a selection list that allows the user to
change between different angle units and normalizations. Selecting it will
adjust the necessary co-ordinates.

<P>When done, press the Done Editing button to return to the main menu.

<P>&nbsp;PeZ allows users to move poles and zeros graphically with the
mouse. Simply hold the left mouse button down while the mouse is above
a pole or zero, and move it around the Z-Plane without letting go of the
left mouse button. To make selection easier, the user may also click on
a pole's or zero's multiplicity in the same manner and PeZ will understand
that the particular pole/zero is to be moved.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
Real-Time Mouse Drag</H2>
Clicking on the Real Time Drag Plots checkbox tells PeZ that the user wants
to see how the plots looks as the user drags poles or zeros around in the
Z-Plane. While a great deal of work has been done to optimize calculations
for real-time plotting, some machines may not be able to keep up with the
user's pole/zero dragging. Should the PeZ fail to keep up with the user,
turn off the Real-Time Drag Plots option to move poles and zeros smoothly.

<P>While a user is moving a pole/zero around with the rt-drag option turned
on, the figure plots' axis are held constant to the scale of their starting
values. This helps give users a better idea of how the positioning affects
the plots, relative to a constant scaling. When a position is finalized
by releasing the mouse button, PeZ rescales the axis to better show the
new data points.

<P>Implementation note: Due to inconsistencies in the Macintosh's version
of Matlab, the real-time display will not be as smooth as on other computers.
This appears to be a bug for Matlab v5.1, but in any case the real-time
plotting should be acceptable.
