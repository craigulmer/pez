<H3>Add Overview</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The ADD pole/zero options are fairly simple. In general, you click on either
the add pole or zero button, move the mouse over to the Z-plane, and then
click the destination of where you want to place pole or zero. If you change
your mind and decide that you do not want to add a pole or zero, simply click
the mouse outside of the Z-plane (but still in the main control window), and
PEZ will take you out of the add mode. <BR>
<BR>
When you are adding a pole or zero, PEZ uses the Weight value to determine how
many poles or zeros are added to the Z-Plane. If you add poles or zeros on
top of existing poles or zeros, PEZ does all of the nasty work of analyzing
the situation and makes the right changes. For example, if you have a 
current weight of 4, and add a pole on top of a location that already has 
2 zeros, PEZ will remove the two zeros and replace them with 2 poles.<BR>
<BR>
Additionally, PEZ is configured to represent REAL systems. This means that
if you have a pole or zero with an imaginary component, PEZ will automatically
add the complex conjugate.  This results in a mirroring across the real
(or X) axis. <BR>

<H2>The Different ADD Options:</H2>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>Add Single Weighted:</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This option allows you to add a single weighted pole or zero.
The new addition is (as with all objects) mirrored across the real axis.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>Add Multiple Weighted:</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This option allows you to add a several weighted poles or zeros.
It is in effect the same as repeating the Add Single option several times
until the user clicks outside the bounds of the Z-Axis.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>Add Double:</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These options are built for adding poles and zeros with mirrors 
about the unit circle. For example, clicking on a Add Double Pole, and 
clicking close to the unit circle (on the inner side) can result in a plot
such as:<BR>

For the Double Add Pole/Zero Combo, An operation similar to an add double
is performed, but this time a pole is placed inside the unit circle, and a 
zero is mirrored outside of the unit circle. It does not matter whether you
click inside or outside of the unit circle, PEZ will figure out where to
place what for you, such as this Double Pole/Zero Combo Add:<BR>

<H2>Changing The Weight:</H2>
<IMAGE SRC="../Graphics/pez7.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For the Add and Delete options of PEZ, a Weight control box is added to allow
easier manipulations of weighted poles or zeros.  Basically, whenever there
is an Add or Delete operation, PEZ uses the Current Weight value to determine
how many objects should be placed or removed from the current location.<BR>
<BR>
For example, if you wanted to insert a delay of 5 in the impulse response,
you would want to add 5 poles at the origin of the Z-plane. Rather than
adding the 5 poles by hand, you could change the current weight to 5, then add
a single pole at the origin. A small number 5 will be placed next to your new
pole to signify that there are 5 poles for the one pole marking in the 
Z-Plane.<BR>
<BR>
PEZ maintains a list of how many of what are where, and maintains the list
to reflect changes in the filter.
