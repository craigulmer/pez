<H2>File Options</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
PEZ supports a few different ways to save and load data relating to
the filter you have designed. The file options are:<BR>

<UL>
<LI> Save data in a PEZ format 
<LI> Load data stored in a PEZ format
<LI> Export data as two Polynomial Vectors (One for Zeros, one for Poles)
<LI> Export data as two Roots Vectors (One for Zeros, one for Poles)
<LI> Print to Printer, Postscript, Enhanced Postscript, or Compuserve GIF file
</UL>

<H3>PEZ Data File Description</H3>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The internal PEZ data files that PEZ uses to save and load data basically 
hold all the variables that PEZ needs to reconstruct your filter simply.
They are stored in one singular *.mat data file. This does not allow an
easy way to import data into PEZ, and general imports of outside data will
be included in the next release of PEZ.<BR>

<H3>PEZ Export File Descriptions</H3>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The export facilities provide an easy way to save your filter in a form
that can be used in MATLAB. As with the internal PEZ data format, 
the necessary vectors are saved to a single MATLAB file. To access the 
vectors, load the mat file. For a Polynomial export there will be two
vectors: pole_poly_list and zero_poly_list. These files should be in
order for direct calls to functions such as freqz(). Similarly a
Roots export will generate the roots of the filter with the names of
pole_roots_list and zero_roots_list. The polynomial can be formed
by calling the function poly().<BR>

<H3>Clearing the Z-Plane</H3>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The main control window has a few menu options to clear all of the poles
and/or zeros from the work area. These options will do deletions
permanently, so make sure you pay attention to what you're doing with
these options or you will lose your work!<BR>

<H3>Quick-Sizing the Windows</H3>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
On both the Main Control Window and the Plots Window are options to allow
for the quick resizing of the windows. Due to the large amount of screen
space that PEZ can take up, there are a few options to quickly change the 
size of PEZ's windows. While in the smaller modes text can become unreadable,
the functionality of the windows are still in tact. Future versions
of PEZ may reflect changes in OS dimensions.<BR>

<H2>Resizing the Z-Plane</H2> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Just below the Z-Plane in the Main Control Window is a gadget to
zoom in and out of the Z-Plane. The value in this gadget determines
what the magnitude of the Z-Plane Axis is.<BR>
