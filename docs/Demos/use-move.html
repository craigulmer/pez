<H2>Move Overview</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The move options allow you to change the locations of poles and zeros you
have already placed. A few different move options are available to
facilitate different needs: simple drag and drop move, move with real time
plot updates, and point to point moves. <BR>

<H2>Simple Drag With Mouse</H2> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Simple Drag With Mouse button allows you to change the location of a pole
or zero by dragging it around the screen. The Procedure for doing this consists
of:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI> Press the "Drag With Mouse" Button
<LI> Move the mouse pointer to the Z-Plane in the Control Window.
<LI> Move the mouse over the pole or zero you want to move and press the
     left mouse button.
<LI> With the mouse button still held down, drag the pole or zero around 
the Z-plane until the object is in the new location.     
<LI> Let go of the mouse button to finalize the move.
<UL>
<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sometimes an object that is moved continues to "stick" to the mouse pointer
even after it has been dropped at a new location.  This "miss" is due to the computer
not being able to monitor the mouse fast enough.  Simply click the mouse
button again to register the final position of the move.<BR>

<H2>Drag With Mouse And Real Time Plots</H2> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This option allows you to drag poles or zeros as above, but the output
plots are updated as you move an object around the Z-Plane. The procedure
for this option follows as:<BR>
<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> Press the "Drag & Draw Plots" Button"
<LI> Move the mouse pointer to the Z-Plane in the Control Window.
<LI> Move the mouse over the pole or zero you want to move and press the
     left mouse button.
<LI> With the mouse button still held down, drag the pole or zero around 
the Z-plane until the object is in the new location.     
<LI> Let go of the mouse button to finalize the move.

Due to the computational nature of this operation, updates and movements
are generally slow. If the object you are moving does not wind up where
your mouse pointer is, try moving the mouse slightly(Updates are based
on mouse movement).<BR>

<H2>Move Object from Current Point To New Point</H2> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This option allows you specify the new location of a pole or zero with
the mouse. The concept is to move the object from one point to a new
point without the overhead found in the drag moves. The procedure for
moving a pole zero from point to point follows as:<BR>
<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> Press the "Point to Point" Button"
<LI> Move the mouse pointer to the Z-Plane in the Control Window.
<LI> Move the mouse over the pole or zero you want to move and press and
     release the left mouse button. (This selects the object)
<LI> Now move the mouse pointer to the new position of where you want the
     pole or zero to be moved to, and click and release the left mouse
     button.
