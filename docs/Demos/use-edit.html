<H2>Delete Use:</H2>
<IMAGE SRC="../Graphics/pez13.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Delete options allow two different ways of deleting poles and zeros:
single or multiple.  The "Select & Delete Weighted" button will allow
you to delete a single pole or zero with the mouse.  The number of poles
or zeros that are removed in cases where the selected object has an order
higher than one depends on what the current weight is. <BR>
<BR>
The "Select & Delete Multiple" button does the same work as the "Select
& Delete Weighted" button except that it allows for batch deletions. This
allows the user to delete several objects in a row without having to click
the "Select & Delete Weighted" button several times. To get out of the
Delete Multiple mode, click the mouse outside of the Z-Plane.<BR>
