If you're interested in seeing what the point of some of this Z-Plane
stuff is, try some of the following questions. In each case, start with
a blank Z-Plane (ie, do a clear-->all before running each question).

<H4>Frequency Response</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Add a single pole just inside of the unit circle(Just make sure it has
an imaginary component to it so that it is mirrored across the Real axis).
Use the Drag & Draw plots option to drag the pole around a complete
revolution of the unit circle. As you drag the pole, watch what happens
to the Frequency Response plots. What do you see?<BR>
<BR>
Add a pole-zero combination with the "add pole-zero combo" button.  What
kind of frequency response do you get back?<BR>
