Introduction</H2>
PeZ is a decently featured Pole-Zero Editor for Matlab designed to help
users graphically examine the complex z-plane. While many other people
have written Pole-Zero editors over the years, PeZ differs in that it is
written entirely in Matlab allowing for wide portability and expansion.
The interpretted nature of Matlab code allows practically any machine with
a recent port of Matlab the ability to run PeZ. The open testbed nature
of Matlab also allows users the ability to freely access and use the data
manipulated with PeZ. This ability to prod and connect PeZ to other Matlab
applications makes PeZ a decent tool for students to explore the characteristics
of the Z-Plane.

<H2>
New Features for PeZ v3.1</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>MATLAB v4.2 and 5.1 Compatibility:</B> Due to the number of changes
that Mathworks had to make in the GUI controls for the recent v5 release,
a lot of the GUI code had to be reworked to be functional with the new
system.</LI>

<LI>
<B>UNIX, MAC, and PC Recognition:</B> While Matlab code is in theory the
same for all machines, GUI code has a tendency to be inconsistent between
platforms. I've made adjustments to the code to compensate for some of
these problems.</LI>

<LI>
<B><A HREF="pez_edit.htm#Edit by Mouse Drag">Real-Time Plots:</A></B> A
great deal of work was put into speeding up the plots so that they can
occur in a real-time fashion.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Cosmetic &amp; Bug Fixes: </B>Updated several minor problems and changed
labels for easier use.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Documentation:</B> Previous documentation was from several releases
ago</LI>

Compatibility Issues</H3>
Since Matlab is an interpreted language for multiple machines, there are
always implementation variances based on the system. We have tested Pez
under a number of configurations, but check the <A HREF="./compat.htm">Compatibility
Issues page</A> for more specific info. The page also lists some "<B>what
to do if it doesn't work</B>" ideas.

This version of PeZ had particular help from a daring pair at Rose-Hulman.
They took on the difficult task of sorting through my spagetti code in
order to speed up the plots for a better real-time appearance. The result
impressed me, and I took their work and applied it with my own twists for
Pez to work on different platforms. Special thanks go to these guys:
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Brad North :</FONT> The student that came up with a PC optimized
version and figured out the neat redraw tricks. I originally gave up on
the tricks he did because they were difficult to work with. Brad trodded
through and got it all to work! Sorry for having you look at such bad code!</LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Dr. Yoder :</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1> </FONT>The professor at
Rose-Hulman that pushed on everything and always has a mind to try something
new. Thanks!</LI>

Thanks:</H2>
I couldn't have worked on Pez without the support of a lot of people. A
special thanks must go to the following:
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.ece.gatech.edu/users/478/">Dr. Schafer</A> -- for getting
me started on the Matlab projects, explaining the difficult stuff patiently,
teaching me how to spell "Zero", and being the first prof to learn my name.</LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.ece.gatech.edu/users/223/">Dr. McClellan</A> -- for
looking pushing me on getting it done, improving my code, giving me the
latest gossip on Matlab, and being a great prof in general.</LI>

<LI>
Dr. Jeff Schodorf -- for all the great work on the CD and being a TA to
look up to. Good luck with the new job!</LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.ece.gatech.edu/users/amer">Amer Abufadel</A>, Darrell
Stogner, Vivek Garg, and Phviu Nguyen -- for all the late night breaks,
painful "Wouldn't it be neat if"s, and the continuous stream of "why the
hell are you still working on that??Are you getting any money out of this?"</LI>

<LI>
The EE2200 students -- for keeping asking WHY?!?</LI>

<LI>
And most importanly, Amy, for everything goofy.</LI>
