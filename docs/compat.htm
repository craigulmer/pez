PeZ Compatibility Issues</H1>
Matlab is an interpreted language that runs on several computer platforms.
While the majority of Matlab core programs work flawlessly across different
machines, it would be optimistic to hope that a language environment could
be created that would work 100% of the time for all machine configurations.
Since graphical functions vary the most from machine os to os, the problem
becomes even more frustrating for those attempting to create a consistent
Graphical User Interface on multiple machines.

<P>PeZ attempts to compensate for differences not only between machines,
but also between different versions of Matlab. Currently there are two
major revisions of Matlab- v4.2 and v5.x. While Mathworks did a great amount
of work in v5.0 to stay compatible with v4.2, there are some large changes
that make this difficult. This page will hopefully help in correcting some
problems you may experience for your particular system.

Machines Tested on:</H2>
At one point or another, I can say that we've run Pez on the following
machines:
<UL>
<LI>
HP-Unix: v4.2/5.0</LI>

<LI>
PC-Win95: v4.2</LI>

<LI>
PC-NT: v5.0</LI>

<LI>
Mac: v4.2/5.0</LI>
</UL>
If you have errors or bug reports, <A HREF="mailto:grimace@ee.gatech.edu">please
let me know</A>.

Warning Messages (v5.0+)</H2>
Due to gui changes in Matlab v5.0, Matlab will warn you the first time
you attempt to use a gui call designed for v4.2. While a great number of
these warnings have been fixed, there is one particular warning that happens
every&nbsp; time pez is started in a Matlab shell for the first time. The
command line will spit out a warning very much like this one:
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER NOSAVE >
<TR>
<TD><TT>>> pez</TT>
<BR><TT>>>&nbsp;</TT>
<BR><TT>Warning: Setting marker type based on 'LineStyle' property</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Marker' and 'LineStyle'
have been made separate properties</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use 'Marker' property
to remove this warning.</TT>
<BR><TT>> In /home/users/joe_six_pack/pez_plot.m at line 57</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; In /home/users/joe_six_pack/pez_bin.m at line 129</TT>
<BR><TT></TT>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>


<P>This is <B>not a problem.</B> This is a simple warning that is necessary
in order to stay compatible with Matlab v4.2. Again, this warning should
only pop up once in a new shell.

<H2>
Mouse Pointer Residue (Mac)</H2>
There is a bug with Matlab's <B>ginput()</B> command that will on occasion
cause old pointer graphics to remain on the screen. Currently there isn't
much of a fix other than to get an updated copy from Mathworks.

End-of-Line Termination (Unix vs. Mac vs. PC)</H2>
The PC, MAC, and Unix text file formats use different termination characters
for Text files. Therefore, if you are a PC person reading a text file typed
on a Unix box, chances are you'll see one long stream of characters with
no carriage returns. This is an age old problem and don't bug me about
it. Since Unix is the most universal text format, it is the format of choice.
It <B>SHOULD run FINE </B>on all three platforms since Matlab doesn't care
too much about white space. If you need to edit the files:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Unix</B>: No problem, is in the right format. There is a common utility
called "dos2unix" that can do the translations.</LI>

<LI>
<B>PC</B>: If you need to convert there are programs out there, but you
can simply use <B>edit.com </B>to make the change. Edit is a simple do
editor that comes with windows that is smart enough to make the conversion
automatically. Load the file, then save it.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Mac</B>: Not sure, there are supposedly common converters.</LI>
</UL>

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H2>
Sluggy Updates (Mac)</H2>
Mac's seem to have a bug in the way that plot updates are done. Since I
couldn't find a guaranteed fix for this, the Mac version does plain updates
of all plots. This will be a good deal slower for real-time generation,
but it seems to work.

Missing Functions</H2>
Some installations of Matlab may not have all the source files installed.
While Pez has been written to use as few external functions as possible,
you may get unusual errors that seem to indicate a function cannot be performed.
Here are the missing functions I have seen:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
<B>grpdelay.m</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; : You may see some error about frs_omega
or something. I found this when I did not install all of the signal libraries
with Matlab v4.2 on a PC. Pez attempts to detect this, but is not 100%
effective.</LI>

<LI>
<B>filtdemo.m</B>&nbsp; : This is a m-file that comes with the signal processing
toolbox. You may not have it installed, Pez should now avoid this missing
function and just warn you about it.</LI>
</UL>


<P>If you are missing the file, the solution is to just <B>make a dummy
version</B> of it. For example, if you do not have grpdelay.m (do a <TT>"which
grpdelay"</TT>), then create the following file called <B>grpdelay.m </B>in
your current directory:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER NOSAVE >
<TR>
<TD>function grpdelay&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
